# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, most of the starter code was given to me. The provided code included the setup for the maze environment, the TreasureMaze and GameExperience classes, as well as helper functions for displaying the maze and keeping track of actions and rewards. This code created the foundation for the project by handling the maze grid, the pirate’s movements, rewards, penalties, and overall game flow. What I had to create myself was the Q-training algorithm, which applied reinforcement learning so the agent could learn how to navigate the maze and reach the treasure efficiently. This part required me to connect the learning model to the environment, update Q-values, and refine the balance between exploration and exploitation.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science? What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Connecting my learning from this course to the larger field of computer science, I see that computer scientists focus on solving problems using structured, logical approaches, and their work matters because it drives innovation in nearly every industry. Whether it’s building apps, training machine learning models, or designing secure systems, computer scientists create solutions that impact how people live and work every day.


# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I break it down into smaller, manageable parts and apply algorithms, models, or design patterns that fit the situation. This mindset helps me troubleshoot effectively and steadily work toward a solution.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I’ve learned that computer scientists have ethical responsibilities to both end users and organizations. It is important to ensure that systems are reliable, secure, and respectful of user privacy. The choices made during design and development can have lasting effects, which makes considering ethics just as critical as solving the technical challenges.
